### Analysis Summary

I can help you create a diagram. What kind of diagram do you want to create? Please provide me with more details about the information you want to represent in the diagram. For example, are you looking for:

*   **A diagram of the codebase structure?** If so, which part of the codebase?
*   **A diagram showing the relationships between different components or modules?**
*   **A diagram illustrating a specific process or data flow?**
*   **Something else entirely?**

The more information you give me, the better I can assist you!

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Diagram Request**
   The user's request for a diagram is met with a clarifying question to understand the specific type of diagram needed. This initial step aims to gather more details about the user's intent, such as whether they are looking for a codebase structure diagram, component relationships, or a process flow.
